  # As the previous job will always install the dependencies from cmake, and this is guaranteed to
  # work, we also want to support dev sandboxes where the main dependencies are already
  # pre-installed in the system. For now, we only support dev machines under a GNU/Linux
  # environmnets. If you are reading this and need the same functionallity in Windows/macOS please
  # open a ticket.
