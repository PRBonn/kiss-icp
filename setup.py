    For whatever reason, when building the package in isolated mode (PEP 517) the cmake and ninja
    dependencies (that are indeed installed by the build system)do not expose the binary paths.
    Internally scikit-build uses $PATH/cmake and $PATH/ninja to analyze if those tools are installed
    on the system or not. Since this is not working, the workaround for those machines that do not
    have a local installation of the tools is to update the path with the given binary dirs from the
    isolation-installed packages.
